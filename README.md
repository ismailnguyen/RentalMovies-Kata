# RentalMovies-Kata

``RentalMovies``

The sample program is very simple. It is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer's charges at a video store. 
The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long. 
It then calculates the charges, which depend on how long the movie is rented, and identifies the type movie. 
There are three kinds of movies: regular, children's, and new releases. 
In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether the film is a new release.

Legacy Code Rules

You cannot change production code if not covered by tests

Just automated refactoring (via IDEs) are allowed, if needed to write the test
